**Focused on user value**: ✅ PASS
- All user stories describe user goals and benefits
- Requirements map to user needs
- Success criteria measure user outcomes

**Written for non-technical stakeholders**: ✅ PASS
- Plain language descriptions throughout
- Technical concepts explained in user terms

- Requirements: 49 functional requirements organized by 6 infrastructure categories
- Success Criteria: 15 measurable outcomes
- Edge Cases: 10 scenarios identified
- Assumptions: 12 documented
- Dependencies: 7 identified

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: ✅ PASS
- All 3 clarifications resolved:
  - FR-005: Email verification via two-step POST process (user answered)
  - FR-012: API key-based pilot phase, transition to public (user answered, was FR-011)
  - FR-031: Curated Discord subset, not full parity (user answered, was FR-050)
- Status: Complete, ready for planning

**Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: ✅ PASS
- Each requirement uses MUST language with specific capabilities
- Requirements specify inputs and expected outputs
- Acceptance scenarios provide concrete test cases

**Success criteria are measurable**: ✅ PASS
- All 15 criteria include quantifiable metrics
- Examples: "under 60 seconds", "within 500 milliseconds", "80% of users", "70% reduction"

**Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: ✅ PASS
- Focused on user-facing outcomes and business metrics
- No framework or language specifics
- Performance targets expressed in user terms

**All acceptance scenarios are defined**: ✅ PASS
- Each user story includes 6 Given/When/Then scenarios
- Scenarios cover happy paths and key variations
- Total of 36 acceptance scenarios across 6 platform infrastructure stories

**Edge cases are identified**: ✅ PASS
- 10 edge cases documented with proposed handling strategies
- Cover failure scenarios, data conflicts, and system limits
- Include both technical and user experience edge cases

**Scope is clearly bounded**: ✅ PASS
- Feature prioritization (P1-P6) establishes scope hierarchy
- Dependencies section identifies external requirements
- Edge cases clarify behavior boundaries

**Dependencies and assumptions identified**: ✅ PASS
- 12 assumptions documented (A-001 through A-012)
- 7 dependencies documented (D-001 through D-007)
- Assumptions cover data formats, system constraints, and standards

### Feature Readiness Assessment

**All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: ✅ PASS
- User stories provide acceptance scenarios that map to requirements
- Edge cases extend acceptance criteria for boundary conditions
- Requirements organized by feature area matching user stories

**User scenarios cover primary flows**: ✅ PASS
- 6 prioritized user stories covering platform infrastructure
- P1 (authentication & identity linking) establishes foundation
- P2 (game data API integration) provides data layer
- P3 (RESTful API architecture) enables feature development
- P4 (Discord bot framework) extends reach
- P5 (data persistence) enables storage
- P6 (API key management) controls access
- Independent testability ensures platform viability at each priority level

**Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria**: ✅ PASS
- Success criteria map to platform infrastructure:
  - SC-001, SC-002, SC-010: Authentication & identity linking (P1)
  - SC-003, SC-004, SC-015: Game data API integration (P2)
  - SC-005, SC-012: RESTful API architecture (P3)
  - SC-007, SC-008: Discord bot framework (P4)
  - SC-009, SC-014: Data persistence (P5)
  - SC-013: API key management (P6)
  - SC-006, SC-011: System-wide performance & reliability

**No implementation details leak into specification**: ✅ PASS
- Spec describes WHAT not HOW
- Technology references are user-facing choices (Discord OAuth) or specified by user (Supabase, Next.js)
- Architecture patterns avoided (no mention of state management, API patterns, data structures)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING PHASE

**Summary**: The specification is complete, validated, and ready for `/speckit.plan`. All clarifications have been resolved with user input. The spec correctly focuses on platform infrastructure (authentication, game data integration, API architecture, Discord bot framework, data persistence, API key management) rather than individual features (which will be separate specs).

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. ✅ **Q1 - Player ID linking method**: Email verification via BitCraft's two-step POST API (trigger code, validate code, store email + player ID)
2. ✅ **Q2 - Game data API access control**: Pilot phase with API key-based access control for approved clients, transition to fully public API in future
3. ✅ **Q3 - Discord bot feature scope**: Curated subset of features optimized for Discord interaction, not full feature parity with web UI

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ All 3 clarification questions answered by user
2. ✅ Spec updated with clarified requirements (FR-005, FR-012, FR-031)
3. ✅ Spec re-scoped to focus on platform infrastructure only
4. ✅ Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase

## Notes

- **Scope Correction**: Spec correctly focused on platform infrastructure - individual features (recipes, workflows, maps, resource tracking, empire planning) will be separate specifications
- **Platform Foundation**: 6 prioritized infrastructure components that future features will consume
- **Complete**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remaining - all 3 resolved
- **Quality**: 49 functional requirements, 15 measurable success criteria (all technology-agnostic), 36 acceptance scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: 10 scenarios covering failure modes, race conditions, scaling challenges
- **Dependencies**: 7 external dependencies identified with clear requirements
- **User Input**: All 3 clarifications answered with specific, actionable decisions
