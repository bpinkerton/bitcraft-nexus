# Feature Specification: Workspace Restructuring

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-need-to`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I need to turn this repository into a monorepo in order to support an accompanying discord.js application."

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19

- Q: What would you prefer as the feature name? → A: Workspace Restructuring
- Q: What monorepo management tool should be used for this restructuring? → A: Keep existing pnpm workspace (already configured)
- Q: What type of Discord bot functionality is expected to be integrated? → A: Integration bot that connects Discord with the web app
- Q: How should the Discord bot and web app share data/integration? → A: Shared database access (both apps connect to same DB)
- Q: How should database schemas be shared between the applications? → A: Centralized schema management

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Repository Structure Conversion (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to convert the existing repository into a monorepo structure so that I can manage multiple applications (Next.js web app and Discord integration bot) in a single codebase.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational change that enables all other functionality. Without proper monorepo structure, the Discord.js application cannot be integrated effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that the existing Next.js application continues to function normally after restructuring, and that new workspace directories are created for the Discord integration bot.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing Next.js application in the root directory, **When** the repository is restructured into a monorepo, **Then** the Next.js application continues to work without any functionality changes
2. **Given** a monorepo structure, **When** a developer navigates to the web application directory, **Then** they can run the Next.js application using standard commands
3. **Given** a monorepo structure, **When** a developer navigates to the Discord bot directory, **Then** they can run the Discord integration bot independently

### User Story 2 - Shared Dependency Management (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need to manage shared dependencies and utilities across both applications so that I can avoid code duplication and maintain consistency.

**Why this priority**: Shared dependencies reduce maintenance overhead and ensure consistency between applications. This becomes critical as both applications grow and need to share common functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a shared utility function and verifying that both applications can import and use it without conflicts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a shared utilities package, **When** both applications import the same utility function, **Then** both applications can use the function without version conflicts
2. **Given** shared configuration files, **When** either application needs configuration updates, **Then** changes can be made in one place and affect both applications appropriately
3. **Given** shared database access, **When** both applications need to access user data, **Then** they can read and write to the same database tables consistently

---

### User Story 3 - Independent Application Deployment (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need to deploy each application independently so that I can update the web application and Discord bot separately without affecting each other.

**Why this priority**: Independent deployment allows for faster iteration cycles and reduces risk when updating one application without affecting the other.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying only the web application and verifying the Discord bot continues running, then deploying only the Discord bot and verifying the web application remains unaffected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** both applications are running, **When** the web application is updated and redeployed, **Then** the Discord bot continues running without interruption
2. **Given** both applications are running, **When** the Discord bot is updated and redeployed, **Then** the web application continues serving users without interruption
3. **Given** a deployment pipeline, **When** changes are made to shared dependencies, **Then** both applications can be updated together or independently as needed

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when shared dependencies have conflicting version requirements between applications?
- How does the system handle deployment failures for one application while the other is running?
- What happens when both applications need to access the same external resources simultaneously?
- How does the system handle configuration changes that affect both applications?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain existing Next.js application functionality without any breaking changes
- **FR-002**: System MUST create separate workspace directories for web application and Discord bot using existing pnpm workspace configuration
- **FR-003**: System MUST support independent dependency management for each application
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide shared dependency management for common utilities, configurations, and database access
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable independent build and deployment processes for each application
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain consistent code quality and linting across all workspaces
- **FR-007**: System MUST support shared TypeScript configurations and type definitions
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide unified testing capabilities across all applications
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain existing CI/CD pipeline functionality
- **FR-010**: System MUST support environment variable management for each application independently
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide centralized database schema management accessible to both applications

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Workspace**: Represents an independent application or package within the monorepo, containing its own dependencies and configuration
- **Shared Package**: Represents common utilities, types, or configurations that can be used across multiple workspaces
- **Build Configuration**: Represents the settings and scripts needed to build, test, and deploy each workspace independently
- **Centralized Schema**: Represents the unified database schema management system accessible to both web application and Discord bot

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Existing Next.js application functionality remains 100% intact after monorepo conversion
- **SC-002**: Both applications can be built and run independently within 30 seconds of each other
- **SC-003**: Shared dependencies can be updated across all workspaces in under 2 minutes
- **SC-004**: New developers can set up and run both applications within 10 minutes of cloning the repository
- **SC-005**: Deployment pipeline successfully deploys applications independently 95% of the time
- **SC-006**: Code quality metrics (linting, testing) maintain current standards across all workspaces
- **SC-007**: Build times for individual applications do not increase by more than 20% compared to standalone versions
